# MobX

[CodeSandbox demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pshrmn/curi/tree/master/examples/react/mobx)

**Note:** This example no longer integrates the Curi router into MobX because it is no longer necessary for providing "deep" updates. You can still use `@curi/mobx` if you want this data in your MobX store, but it isn't necessary.
