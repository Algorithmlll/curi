# Redux

[CodeSandbox demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pshrmn/curi/tree/master/examples/react/redux)

**Note:** This example no longer integrates the Curi router into Redux because it is no longer necessary for providing "deep" updates. You can still use `@curi/redux` if you want this data in your Redux store, but it isn't necessary.
