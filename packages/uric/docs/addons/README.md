# Addons

Addons allow you to register functions associated with `uri`s. Then, you can call functions associated with a `uri` just by knowing that `uri`'s name. This allows you to do things like generate location pathnames and prefetch data.

## List of built-in addons

* [`pathname`](./pathname.md)
* [`prefetch`](./prefetch.md)
