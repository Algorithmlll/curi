## 0.10.0

* Switch to the [`hickory`](https://github.com/pshrmn/hickory) package for history.
* Remove `path-to-regexp` from the ES/CommonJS builds.

## 0.9.0

* New build (uses Rollup to output a single file for each build type).

## 0.8.3

* Change `config.ready` function to always return the `Promise` that is generating (or generated) the most recent response.

## 0.8.2

* Updated to `history@4.6.2` (no more automatic `pathname` encoding).

## 0.8.1

* Fixed bug with setting `response.body` too early, which broke async body loading.
* Fixed bug with the cache returning a `ResponseCreator` and not a `response`.

## 0.8.0

* Drop the route's `value`/`call` properties in favor of just one: `body`. This **must** be a function (whose return value will be set as a response's `body` property).

## 0.7.5

* Fixed route matching for routes with children when no child routes match.

## 0.7.3

* The configuration object begins making a response object when its `setup` method is called.
* When a subscriber function subscribes, it is always called immediately. If the initial response object has not resolved, the subscriber function will be passed `undefined`.

## 0.7.1

* Renamed `Response` to `ResponseCreator` (makes it easier to differentiate it from response objects).
* Add `ResponseCreator.setData`, which will set the `data` property on the response object it creates.
