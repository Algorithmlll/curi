`@curi/redux` provides Redux integration for your application. Instead of using the `<Navigator>` from `@curi/react-navigator` to re-render your application, with `@curi/redux`, you can just rely on Redux to subscribe to your store and re-render whenever the location changes.

## Installation

```
npm install --save @curi/redux
```

For more information, please check out the [`@curi/redux`](https://curi.js.org/packages/@curi/redux) page on the documentation website.
