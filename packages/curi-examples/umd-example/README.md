# UMD Example

This is just a simple example that demonstrates using the UMD builds of `curi`, `curi-react-navigator`, and `curi-react-link` to build an application.

`curi-react-navigator` and `curi-react-link` could easily be replaced with `curi-react` to do the same thing:

```html
<script src="../../../curi-react/umd/curi-react.min.js"></script>
```

```js
const {
  Link,
  Navigator
} = CuriReact;
```
